# Claude AI Music Skills

A complete AI music production workflow for Suno. Install as a Claude Code plugin or clone the repo and start making albums.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a personal project I built to streamline my own music production workflow with Claude Code and Suno. It's being shared publicly in case others find it useful. Active development happens on the `develop` branch — `main` only receives tested, stable releases.
>
> If you run into issues, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bitwize-music-studio/claude-ai-music-skills/issues) or submit a PR.

> [!WARNING]
> **Claude Code Max plan recommended** ($200/month). This plugin uses 51 specialized skills that spawn subagents across Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku models. Session startup, automatic lyric reviews, multi-agent research workflows, and full album production pipelines are all token-intensive. The standard Pro plan will hit rate limits quickly during any multi-track session.

## How It Works

### The Workflow

```
┌─────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌───────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌────────┐    ┌─────────┐
│ Concept │ -> │ Research │ -> │ Write │ -> │ Generate │ -> │ Master │ -> │ Release │
└─────────┘    └──────────┘    └───────┘    └──────────┘    └────────┘    └─────────┘
     │              │               │              │              │              │
     v              v               v              v              v              v
 Plan album    Gather sources  Create lyrics  Generate on    Optimize     Upload &
 Define theme  Verify facts    Check quality  Suno V5        audio for    distribute
 Tracklist     Citations       Pronunciation  Iterate        streaming    to platforms
```

Each phase has specialized skills and quality gates:

| Phase | What Happens | Skills Used |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Concept** | Define album theme, tracklist, sonic direction | `/bitwize-music:album-conceptualizer` |
| **Research** | Gather sources (for true-story albums) | `/bitwize-music:researcher`, `/bitwize-music:document-hunter` |
| **Write** | Create lyrics with quality checks | `/bitwize-music:lyric-writer`, `/bitwize-music:pronunciation-specialist` |
| **Generate** | Create tracks on Suno | `/bitwize-music:suno-engineer` |
| **Polish** | Fix Suno artifacts, per-stem cleanup | `/bitwize-music:mix-engineer` |
| **Master** | Optimize audio for streaming | `/bitwize-music:mastering-engineer` |
| **Release** | QA, upload, distribute | `/bitwize-music:release-director` |

### Skills = Specialized Expertise

Skills are invoked with `/bitwize-music:skill-name`. They can be called explicitly or Claude will use them automatically when relevant.

**Example explicit call:**
```
/bitwize-music:lyric-writer Write verse 2 for track 3
```

**Example automatic use:**
When you say "let's write the lyrics for track 1", Claude automatically applies `/bitwize-music:lyric-writer` expertise including rhyme checks, prosody analysis, and pronunciation scanning.

### File Structure

The plugin separates **plugin files** (skills, templates, reference docs) from **your content** (albums, artists). Your content lives in `{content_root}` (configured in `~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml`).

```
{content_root}/                  # Your workspace
└── artists/your-artist/
    ├── README.md                # Artist profile
    └── albums/hip-hop/my-album/ # Album by genre
        ├── README.md            # Album concept, tracklist
        ├── RESEARCH.md          # Sources (if true-story)
        ├── SOURCES.md           # Citations
        └── tracks/
            ├── 01-first-track.md
            ├── 02-second-track.md
            └── ...
```

Set `content_root` in your config to point to your workspace. You can keep it in the plugin folder (with `artists/` gitignored) or set a separate path to keep content independent.

Each track file contains:
- Concept and narrative role
- Full lyrics
- Suno Style Box (copy to Suno's style field)
- Suno Lyrics Box (copy to Suno's lyrics field)
- Generation log

## Tutorial: Create Your Album

Let's walk through creating an album from scratch.

### Step 1: Start Planning

**You say:**
> Let's make a new album

**Claude will ask about:**
- Artist (existing or new?)
- Genre and sonic direction
- Album concept and theme
- Track count and structure
- Track concepts (what's each song about?)

### Step 2: Approve the Concept

Claude presents the full plan. Review and confirm:
> Ready to start writing

### Step 3: Write Track 1

**You say:**
> Let's write track 1

Claude drafts lyrics and automatically:
- Checks for repeated rhymes
- Analyzes prosody (stressed syllables on beats)
- Scans for pronunciation risks
- Suggests fixes for any issues

**Review and iterate:**
> The second verse feels weak, can we make it more visual?

### Step 4: Prepare for Suno

Once lyrics are approved, Claude fills in:
- **Style Box**: Genre tags, vocal description, instrumentation
- **Lyrics Box**: Lyrics with section tags and phonetic fixes

**Example Style Box:**
```
[your genre], [vocal style],
[instruments], [mood], [tempo] BPM
```

**Example Lyrics Box:**
```
[Verse 1]
Your lyrics here
With section tags

[Chorus]
Hook goes here
...
```

### Step 5: Generate on Suno

1. Open [suno.com](https://suno.com)
2. Copy Style Box → "Style of Music" field
3. Copy Lyrics Box → "Lyrics" field
4. Generate and listen
5. Tell Claude the result:
   > Track 1 generation 1: vocals too quiet, otherwise good

Claude logs the attempt and suggests prompt adjustments.

### Step 6: Iterate Until Happy

Keep generating until you have a keeper:
> Track 1 is done, this one is perfect: [suno-link]

Claude marks it complete and you move to track 2.

### Step 7: Repeat for All Tracks

Work through each track. Claude maintains context across the full album.

### Step 8: Master the Audio

Download WAV files from Suno, then:
> Master the tracks in ~/Music/your-album/

Claude runs the mastering scripts:
- Analyzes loudness (LUFS)
- Applies EQ and limiting
- Targets -14 LUFS for streaming
- Creates `mastered/` folder with final files

### Step 9: Release

> Release the album

Claude runs the release checklist:
- Verifies all tracks are final
- Prepares streaming lyrics for distributors
- Guides you through SoundCloud/distributor upload
- Updates album status and documentation

**Done!** Your album is live.

## Model Strategy

Skills use different Claude models optimized for quality vs cost. On Claude Code Max plans, critical creative outputs use the best models available.

| Model | When Used | Skills |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Opus 4.6** | Critical creative outputs (6 skills) | `/bitwize-music:lyric-writer`, `/bitwize-music:suno-engineer`, `/bitwize-music:album-conceptualizer`, `/bitwize-music:lyric-reviewer`, `/bitwize-music:researchers-legal`, `/bitwize-music:researchers-verifier` |
| **Sonnet 4.5** | Reasoning and coordination (29 skills) | `/bitwize-music:researcher`, `/bitwize-music:pronunciation-specialist`, `/bitwize-music:explicit-checker`, and most other skills |
| **Haiku 4.5** | Rule-based operations (15 skills) | `/bitwize-music:validate-album`, `/bitwize-music:test`, imports, clipboard, help |

**Why different models?**
- **Opus 4.6** for lyrics, Suno prompts, album concepts, lyric review, and legal/verification research — these define the final music and have high error cost
- **Sonnet** for planning, research coordination, and most tasks — excellent quality at lower cost
- **Haiku** for mechanical operations (imports, validation, clipboard) where speed matters more than creativity

**Checking models:** Run `/bitwize-music:skill-model-updater check` to verify all skills use current Claude models. The updater can automatically update model references when new versions release.

## Tips

### For Better Suno Generations

- Put vocal description FIRST in the style prompt
- Be specific: "raspy male vocals" not just "male vocals"
- Use section tags: `[Verse]`, `[Chorus]`, `[Bridge]`
- Avoid artist names (against Suno TOS) - describe the style instead

### For Better Lyrics

- Watch your rhymes - no self-rhymes, no lazy patterns
- Check prosody - stressed syllables should land on strong beats
- Use phonetic spelling for names: "Rah-mohs" not "Ramos"
- Spell out acronyms: "F-B-I" not "FBI"

### For Documentary Albums

- Capture sources FIRST, write lyrics SECOND
- Human verification required before generation
- Never impersonate - narrator voice only
- Every claim must trace to a captured source

---

## Troubleshooting

### Config Not Found

**Problem:** "Config not found at ~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml"

**Solution:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.bitwize-music
cp config/config.example.yaml ~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml
# Edit with your settings
nano ~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml
```

Or use the interactive config tool:
```
/bitwize-music:configure
```

### Album Not Found When Resuming

**Problem:** `/bitwize-music:resume my-album` can't find the album

**Possible causes:**
1. **Wrong album name** - Album names are case-sensitive. Try: `/bitwize-music:resume` (without name) to see all albums
2. **Wrong path in config** - Check `paths.content_root` in `~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml` points to where your albums live
3. **Album in wrong location** - Albums must be in: `{content_root}/artists/{artist}/albums/{genre}/{album}/`

**Debug steps:**
```bash
# Check config
cat ~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml

# List all album READMEs
find ~/your-content-root/artists -name README.md -path "*/albums/*"
```

### Path Resolution Issues

**Problem:** Files created in wrong locations, "path not found" errors

**Common mistakes:**
- Using relative paths instead of reading config
- Forgetting to include artist name in audio/documents paths
- Hardcoding paths instead of using `{content_root}` from config

**The rule:** Always read `~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml` first to get paths. Never assume or hardcode.

**Correct path structure:**
```
{content_root}/artists/{artist}/albums/{genre}/{album}/    # Content
{audio_root}/artists/{artist}/albums/{genre}/{album}/      # Audio (mirrored structure)
{documents_root}/artists/{artist}/albums/{genre}/{album}/  # Documents (mirrored structure)
```

### Python Dependency Issues (Mastering)

**Problem:** Mastering fails with import errors

**Solution:** Install mastering dependencies:
```bash
pip install matchering pyloudnorm scipy numpy soundfile
```

Or use a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.bitwize-music/venv
source ~/.bitwize-music/venv/bin/activate
pip install matchering pyloudnorm scipy numpy soundfile
```

### Playwright Setup (Document Hunter)

**Problem:** `/bitwize-music:document-hunter` fails with browser errors

**Solution:** Install Playwright and browser:
```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install chromium
```

### Plugin Updates Breaking Things

**Problem:** After updating the plugin, things don't work

**Common causes:**
1. **Config schema changed** - Compare your `~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml` with `config/config.example.yaml`
2. **Template changes** - Existing albums may use old template format
3. **Skill renamed or removed** - Check CHANGELOG.md for breaking changes

**Solutions:**
- Backup your config before updating
- Review CHANGELOG.md after updates
- Keep content in separate `content_root` to avoid conflicts

### Skills Not Showing Up

**Problem:** Skills don't appear in `/` menu or can't be invoked

**Check:**
1. Plugin installed correctly: `/plugin list`
2. Skill files exist: `ls ~/.claude/plugins/bitwize-music@claude-ai-music-skills/skills/`
3. Try restarting Claude Code
