- **`voice-checker` skill** — Reviews lyrics and prose for AI-written patterns (abstract noun stacking, over-explained metaphors, cliche escalation, missing idiosyncrasy, prose AI tells); advisory Warning/Info severity
- **Cross-track referencing** — lyric-writer supports callbacks, motifs, and character threads across tracks for concept/narrative albums; new Motifs & Threads and Cross-References template sections
- **Iterative refinement passes** — lyric-writer tighten/strengthen/flow refinement patterns added to craft-reference

### Fixed

## [0.69.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- **Target Duration planning system** — `Target Duration` field threaded through album planning (Phase 3), album/track templates, lyric-writer, suno-engineer, and lyric-reviewer; lookup chain: track → album → genre default
- **Duration-to-word-count mapping** — explicit table in craft-reference.md mapping duration ranges to word count targets for hip-hop and non-hip-hop genres
- **Duration-aware prompt construction** — suno-engineer adjusts structure recommendations based on target duration (under 3:00, 3:00–5:00, over 5:00)
- **Duration override example** — album-planning-guide override template includes duration preferences by format

## [0.68.0] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- **Suno target duration guidance** — lyric-writer word count targets updated to produce 3:30–5:00 minute tracks (previous targets produced 2:00–2:30); genre-specific word counts, structure recommendations, and instrumental tag runtime estimates added to craft-reference.md
- **Length check updated** — quality check #8 now flags songs under 200 words as "likely too short for target duration" and lowers hard-fail thresholds to 400/600 words (non-hip-hop/hip-hop)

## [0.67.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Sheet music URL persistence** — `publish_sheet_music` now writes uploaded R2 URLs back to track and album frontmatter automatically (singles → `sheet_music.pdf`/`musicxml`/`midi` per track, songbook → `sheet_music.songbook` on album README)
- **`prepare_singles.py`** — replaces `fix_titles.py`; copies source files to `singles/` with clean consumer-ready titles, generates `.manifest.json` for track ordering
- **Songbook title page, TOC, and footers** — `create_songbook.py` enhanced with professional title page, table of contents, and configurable footer URL
- **`sheet_music` frontmatter** — new section in track template (`pdf`, `musicxml`, `midi`) and album template (`songbook`) for sheet music download URLs
- **`_update_frontmatter_block()` helper** — reusable function for adding/updating YAML frontmatter blocks in markdown files
- **`public_url` config field** — documented in R2 cloud config for custom CDN domain URLs
- **`enabled` and `footer_url` config fields** — new sheet_music config options for master switch and PDF footer customization
- **8 new tests** — 5 for frontmatter persistence in `TestPublishSheetMusic`, 3 for `TestUpdateFrontmatterBlock`

### Changed
- **`xml` → `musicxml`** — sheet music frontmatter key renamed for clarity
- **Relative R2 key fallback** — when no `public_url` configured, frontmatter is still populated with relative R2 keys instead of skipping entirely

### Removed
- **`fix_titles.py`** — replaced by `prepare_singles.py` with broader functionality

## [0.66.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **12-stem pipeline** — expanded from 6 to 12 stem types matching Suno's full `split_stem` output: guitar, keyboard, strings, brass, woodwinds, and percussion now have dedicated processing chains instead of being dumped into the "other" catch-all
- **Instrument-name keywords** — flexible stem routing matches by instrument name (e.g. "Piano.wav" → keyboard, "Saxophone.wav" → woodwinds, "Trumpet.wav" → brass, "Violin.wav" → strings)
- **Genre overrides for new stems** — 20+ genre presets updated with per-stem settings for guitar, keyboard, strings, brass, woodwinds, and percussion
- **45 new tests** — 6 processor test classes, 12-stem integration test, 6 keyword routing regression tests

### Fixed
- **Percussion/drums separation** — "percussion" keyword no longer routes to "drums"; Suno separates kit drums (kick/snare/hi-hats) from percussion (congas/shakers/tambourine) and they need different processing chains

## [0.65.0] - 2026-02-22

### Reverted
- **`originals/` audio layout** — reverted `originals/` subdirectory layout and `migrate_audio_layout` MCP tool; WAV files remain in album audio root
- **Fade-out support** — reverted `apply_fade_out()` from mastering pipeline and `fade_out` field from track template/parser
- **Mix polish character effects** — reverted `apply_saturation()`, `apply_lowpass()`, `apply_stereo_width()` from mix pipeline and character effect settings from genre presets

These 0.61.0 audio pipeline changes degraded output quality. Infrastructure from 0.62.0–0.63.0 (develop branch model, venv health check, debug logging, `reset_mastering`, `cleanup_legacy_venvs`) is preserved.

## [0.64.0] - 2026-02-22

### Reverted
- **Mastering compression stage** — reverted dedicated compression stage (broke mastering pipeline); will revisit later
- **Stereo width in stems path** — reverted stems stereo width (coupled to compression changes)
- **Bus compression presets** — reverted mix-presets.yaml bus compression presets (dead config without code)

## [0.63.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Bus compression presets** — 16 genre presets in mix-presets.yaml for bus compression stage
- **Stereo width in stems path** — stereo width processing now applied during stems-based polish pipeline
- **Mastering compression stage** — dedicated compression stage added to mastering pipeline
- **Mastering genre confirmation** — mastering-engineer skill now asks to confirm the genre preset before mastering and checks if any tracks need different treatment

- **Configurable debug logging** — new `logging` section in config.yaml enables file-based debug logging with rotation; silent by default, opt-in for development/troubleshooting
- **`reset_mastering` MCP tool** — removes `mastered/` and/or `polished/` subfolders so the mastering pipeline can be re-run cleanly; dry-run safe by default, `originals/` and `stems/` are protected
- **`cleanup_legacy_venvs` MCP tool** — detects and removes stale per-tool venvs (`mastering-env`, `promotion-env`, `cloud-env`) left over from pre-0.40.0; dry-run safe by default
- **Dev mode docs** — CONTRIBUTING.md section explaining how to avoid cached plugin conflicts when using `--plugin-dir`

### Removed
- **Redundant requirements files** — removed `requirements-mastering.txt`, `requirements-mixing.txt`, `requirements-promo.txt`, `requirements-research.txt`, `requirements-sheet-music.txt`, and `tools/cloud/requirements.txt`; the unified `requirements.txt` covers all dependencies

### Fixed
- **Stale venv references** — updated `config/README.md`, `TESTING.md`, `reference/mastering/mastering-workflow.md`, and `skills/test/test-definitions.md` to reference unified `venv/` instead of legacy `mastering-env/`
- **Migration 0.40.0** — added missing `cloud-env` cleanup action
- **CI installs full dependencies** — `test.yml` now uses `requirements.txt` instead of the removed `requirements-mastering.txt`

## [0.62.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **`develop` branch model** — two-branch workflow with `develop` for active work and `main` for stable releases; plugin distribution channels via branch-based marketplace
- **Plugin version in about skill** — `/bitwize-music:about` now reads and displays version from plugin.json dynamically

### Changed
- **CI targets Python 3.11 only** — dropped 3.9/3.10/3.12 matrix; not a library, runs in user's venv
- **CI triggers** — pushes run on `develop` only; `main` validated via PR gate
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — updated for develop/main branch model, release process, co-author line

### Fixed
- **Test count badge** — corrected 2235 → 2238 (3 skipped tests collected by CI)

## [0.61.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **mastering-engineer skill** — updated pre-flight check to look in `originals/` first
- **mix-engineer skill** — updated audio directory convention docs

## [0.60.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Suno stem discovery** — `discover_stems()` maps Suno's exported filenames (`0 Lead Vocals.wav`, `1 Backing Vocals.wav`) to polish pipeline stem roles via keyword-based matching + multi-file combining
- **Mastering auto-recovery** — `master_album` Stage 5 auto-detects recoverable dynamic range failures (LUFS too low + peak at ceiling) and applies `fix_dynamic()` from raw source files before re-verifying
- **`fix_dynamic()` reusable helper** — extracted core fix logic into a function that accepts pipeline settings (target LUFS, EQ, ceiling) instead of hardcoded values
- **12 new tests** — 7 unit tests for `fix_dynamic()`, 5 pipeline tests for auto-recovery scenarios

### Fixed

## [0.41.4] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **MCP server environment** — .mcp.json now explicitly passes CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT env variable to server process, fixing "missing env variable" startup failures

## [0.41.3] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **MCP server startup** — .mcp.json now uses venv Python (`~/.bitwize-music/venv/bin/python3`) instead of system Python, fixing server initialization failures

## [0.41.2] - 2026-02-05

### Changed
- **Setup skill simplified** — only recommends unified venv approach, removed confusing system-wide install options
- **Setup checks venv** — verifies ~/.bitwize-music/venv contents instead of system Python packages

- **MCP server wrapper script** — `servers/state-server/run.py` handles platform-specific venv paths (Windows: `Scripts/python.exe`, Unix: `bin/python3`)
- **Single requirements.txt** — consolidated all dependencies into one file with clear sections for each feature

### Changed
- **MCP server environment variable convention** — server now checks `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` first (standard), then `PLUGIN_ROOT` (legacy), then derives from file location
- **Installation simplified** — one venv setup installs everything: `python3 -m venv ~/.bitwize-music/venv && pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **MCP .mcp.json** — simplified configuration by removing redundant `PLUGIN_ROOT` env variable

### Removed
- **Separate requirements files** — removed `requirements-mcp.txt` and `requirements-cloud.txt` in favor of unified `requirements.txt`

## [0.38.0] - 2026-02-05

### Added
- **MCP server: bitwize-music-state** — bundled MCP server exposing state cache as tools for instant structured responses. Wraps `tools/state/indexer.py` with 9 tools: `find_album`, `list_albums`, `get_track`, `get_session`, `update_session`, `rebuild_state`, `get_config`, `get_ideas`, `get_pending_verifications`. In-memory caching with lazy loading and staleness detection. Server auto-starts when plugin enabled via `.mcp.json`. Requires Python 3.10+, `mcp[cli]>=1.2.0`.
- **Plugin tests: SKILL.md structure validation** — checks all skills have required sections (task description, procedural content, closing guidance, agent title). Accepts common alternatives (## Workflow, ## Step 1, ## Commands, ## Domain Expertise, etc.). Runs as part of pre-commit check #11.
- **CI: plugin tests job** — runs full `run_tests.py` suite (449 tests) in CI, guarded against fork PRs

## [0.37.1] - 2026-02-04

### Changed
- **CI: SHA-pinned action references** — all workflow `uses:` directives now reference exact commit SHAs instead of mutable version tags (checkout v4.3.1, setup-python v5.6.0)
- **CI: fork PR protection** — `test` and `lint` jobs skip for fork PRs to prevent untrusted code execution via modified requirements/test files
- **CI: security gates tests** — unit tests now depend on `security` job (pip-audit) completing first
- **CI: explicit read-only permissions** — all non-release workflows now declare `permissions: { contents: read }`
- **CI: GITHUB_OUTPUT delimiter syntax** — all output variables use heredoc delimiters to prevent injection via newlines
- **CI: dead code fix** — model-updater curl error message now reachable under `set -e`
- **CI: fixed-string grep** — auto-release uses `grep -qF` so semver dots aren't regex wildcards

- **Model validation uses pattern** — skill frontmatter check now uses regex `^claude-(opus|sonnet|haiku)-\d+-\d+-\d{8}$` instead of hardcoded model IDs, allowing new model versions without updating checks
- **Plugin tests check SKILL_INDEX.md** — skill documentation test now checks SKILL_INDEX.md instead of CLAUDE.md (since skills table was moved there)

## [0.35.0] - 2026-02-03

### Added
- **`tools/shared/media_utils.py`** — shared module for color extraction, audio analysis, and ffmpeg helpers (extracted from promotion tools)
- **`tools/shared/text_utils.py`** — shared module for track naming utilities (extracted from sheet-music tools)

### Fixed

### Fixed
- **Mastering summary crash** — `master_tracks.py` summary section crashed with `TypeError` when unpacking `(name, dict)` tuples as plain dicts
- **Album sampler crossfade offsets** — `concatenate_with_crossfade` hardcoded 12-second clip duration instead of using actual `--clip-duration` value, causing audio gaps/overlaps
- **ffprobe crash on failure** — `get_audio_duration` in promo video and album sampler tools now checks `returncode` before parsing output
- **CI expression injection** — moved all `${{ steps.*.outputs.* }}` interpolations in `auto-release.yml` and `model-updater.yml` into `env:` blocks to prevent shell injection via crafted inputs
- **Broad `git add -A` in model-updater** — replaced with targeted file additions to prevent accidental staging of temp files

### Changed
- **Documentation sanitized** — replaced real album names with generic examples across 19 files

## [0.33.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **Pronunciation Table Enforcement rule** — every entry in a track's Pronunciation Notes table must be applied as phonetic spelling in Suno lyrics. The table is a checklist of required substitutions, not documentation. Added full process, verification format, common failures, and anti-pattern examples to lyric-writer SKILL.md. Added to quality check #3 and pitfalls checklist.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-02-01

### Changed
- **CLAUDE.md deduplicated and trimmed to under 40KB** — consolidated 4 checkpoint sections into single table, slimmed Model Strategy to table with doc reference, condensed Lessons Learned, removed redundant sections (Quick Reference, Using Skills for Research, standalone Watch Your Rhymes, CORRECT APPROACH block). No information lost — all content consolidated or referenced elsewhere.

## [0.31.0] - 2026-02-01

### Changed
- **Verse-chorus echo check** replaces chorus lead-in rule — expanded from single-line check to full phrase deduplication.

Covers all verse-to-chorus and bridge-to-chorus transitions.

## [0.30.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **No Invented Contractions rule** — Suno only handles standard pronoun/auxiliary contractions (they'd, wouldn't). Invented forms (signal'd, TV'd, network'd) will mispronounce or skip. Added to Pronunciation section, quality check #3, and pitfalls checklist.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-02-01

### Changed
- **Density/pacing reframed as Suno verse length limits** — replaced abstract syllable-density metrics with practical line counts per verse by genre and BPM. All 67 genre READMEs updated to `Density/pacing (Suno)` with default lines/verse, max safe limits, and BPM-aware guidance.
- **New BPM-aware fallback table** — universal verse length limits when genre README doesn't specify (4 lines at <80 BPM, 6 at 94-110, 6-8 at 110-140)
- **Default 4 lines/verse** unless genre and tempo justify more — shifted from permissive 8-line defaults to conservative 4-line baseline
- **Red flag: 8-line verse at BPM under 100** — now flagged as too dense for Suno
- **Streaming lyrics exception** documented — distributor text can have longer blocks but breaks must match Suno structure
- **Quality check #10 now hard fail** — trim or split any verse over the genre's Suno limit before presenting

## [0.28.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **Genre-specific lyric density/pacing norms** — all 67 genre READMEs now include density character, syllables/line range, max topics/verse, typical BPM, and genre-specific pacing notes under Lyric Conventions
- **Chorus lead-in rule** — the line before a chorus must not duplicate the chorus hook, phrase, or rhyme word. Prevents flat chorus entries.
- **Quality checks expanded to 12** — #10 density/pacing (genre-aware), #11 chorus lead-in, #12 pitfalls checklist
- **4 new pitfalls checklist items** — verse too dense for BPM, too many proper nouns per verse, density mismatch with Musical Direction, chorus lead-in repeats chorus

### Changed
- **Lyric density architecture**: Genre READMEs now own density/pacing norms. SKILL.md keeps universal rules + quick-reference table by genre family.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **Lessons Learned Protocol** — 5-step process for turning production issues into preventive rules. When technical issues are discovered (pronunciation errors, rhyme violations, formatting problems), fix immediately, sweep the album, draft a rule, present to user, and log the lesson.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **Strict homograph handling for Suno pronunciation** — "context is clear" is never acceptable for homographs. Hard process: identify, ASK user (never guess), fix with phonetic spelling in Suno lyrics only, document in track pronunciation table.
- **Full homograph table** — live, read, lead, wound, close, bass, tear, wind with both pronunciations and phonetic spellings

## [0.25.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **Genre-specific lyric conventions for all 67 genres** — research-backed rhyme schemes, verse structures, rhyme quality expectations, key rules, and anti-patterns added to every genre README under a new "Lyric Conventions" section
- **Genre-aware quality checks** — rhyme scheme check (#8) and flow check (#9) now verify conventions match the genre instead of enforcing hip-hop couplets universally
- **Quick-reference rhyme table in lyric-writer** — compact summary of all genre families' default schemes, replacing 190 lines of inlined genre tables with a pointer to genre READMEs

### Changed
- **Architecture**: Genre READMEs now own lyric conventions (rhyme, structure, rules). Lyric-writer SKILL.md keeps universal craft rules + quick-reference table.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **Section length guardrails by genre** — per-section line limits for 12 genre families (all 67 genres) to prevent Suno from rushing, compressing, or skipping lyrics. Covers Hip-Hop, Pop, Rock, Punk, Metal, Country/Folk, Electronic, Ambient, R&B, Jazz, Reggae, and Ballad.
- **Section length enforcement rules** — hard limits that must be trimmed before presenting drafts (hip-hop verse max 8 lines, any chorus max 6 lines, electronic verse max 6 lines, punk kept tight)

### Added
- **Song length guidance for lyric writer** — word count targets by genre (150–250 pop, 200–350 rock/folk, 300–500 hip-hop), default structure (2 verses + chorus + bridge), and hard limits to prevent 800+ word songs that cause Suno to rush or skip sections
- **Length check added to lyric reviewer** — 9-point checklist (was 8-point) now includes word count validation with warning/critical severity levels
- **Suno best practices updated** — "Keep Lyrics Concise" note in Lyric Formatting section explaining shorter lyrics generate better results

## [0.22.0] - 2026-01-31

### Added
- **3 documentary/storytelling hip-hop deep-dives** — focused on narrative architecture, political documentary craft, and storytelling technique:

### Fixed
- **Removed artist/person names from Suno prompt keywords** in Ben Folds deep-dives — replaced "Ben Folds Five style", "Ben Folds solo style", "Ben Folds style", "Paul Buckmaster strings", "Nick Hornby storytelling", and "yMusic chamber rock" with descriptive style keywords (both deep-dive files and piano-rock INDEX.md)

## [0.21.1] - 2026-01-31

### Added

### Added
- **Python logging module** across all 15 tool files — `tools/shared/logging_config.py` with `ColorFormatter` (TTY-aware colored output via `Colors` class) and `setup_logging()`. Errors/warnings/status go to stderr via `logger`, formatted tables and data summaries stay as `print()`. `--verbose`/`--quiet` CLI flags added where argparse exists.
- **Progress indicators** — `tools/shared/progress.py` with `ProgressBar` class (TTY-aware █/░ bar). Added to 7 batch-processing tools: `master_tracks.py`, `analyze_tracks.py`, `reference_master.py`, `upload_to_cloud.py`, `generate_promo_video.py`, `generate_album_sampler.py`, `transcribe.py`.
- **Retry logic for cloud uploads** — `retry_upload()` in `upload_to_cloud.py` with exponential backoff (1s/2s/4s), `--retries` CLI arg (default: 3). Retries on `ClientError` (except 403/404), `ConnectionError`, `Timeout`.
- **Concurrent processing** — `-j`/`--jobs` CLI arg in 4 tools: `master_tracks.py` and `analyze_tracks.py` (`ProcessPoolExecutor`), `transcribe.py` and `generate_promo_video.py` (`ThreadPoolExecutor`). Default: 1 (sequential), 0 = auto (CPU count).
- **State cache cleanup command** — `python tools/state/indexer.py cleanup` removes albums from cache whose paths no longer exist on disk. Supports `--dry-run`.
- **New shared modules** — `tools/shared/logging_config.py`, `tools/shared/progress.py`, `tools/shared/__init__.py`
- **Test coverage improvements** — 180 tests (up from 137), 91% coverage. New test files: `test_logging_config.py` (13 tests), `test_progress.py` (14 tests). New test classes in `test_indexer.py`: `TestCmdCleanup`, `TestCmdRebuild`, `TestCmdValidate`, `TestCmdShow`, `TestCmdUpdate`. Edge case tests added to `test_parsers.py`.
- **Dev tooling** — `requirements-test.txt` (pytest, pyyaml, ruff, pytest-cov), `ruff.toml` config, CI workflow updated with test and lint jobs

## [0.19.3] - 2026-01-29

### Changed
- **Venv-first messaging** across all tools and skills — error messages in `upload_to_cloud.py` and `generate_promo_video.py` now show venv setup commands instead of bare `pip install`. Cloud-uploader and promo-director SKILL.md docs updated to present venv as the primary (not alternative) approach.

## [0.19.2] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed
- **Cloud upload album discovery** in `upload_to_cloud.py` — added recursive glob fallback when standard flat path (`{audio_root}/{artist}/{album}`) doesn't exist. Handles audio directories that mirror the content structure with genre folders (e.g., `artists/bitwize/albums/rock/shell-no/`). Reports all checked paths on failure.

## [0.19.1] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed
- **Cloud upload path resolution** in `upload_to_cloud.py` — when `--audio-root` override already includes the artist path, the script no longer doubles it (e.g., `.../bitwize/albums/rock/bitwize/shell-no`). Now tries standard path first, then falls back to direct `{override}/{album}` lookup.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-01-29

### Added
- **Per-feature requirements files** - Install only what you need:
  - `requirements-mastering.txt` - Audio mastering (matchering, pyloudnorm, scipy, numpy, soundfile)
  - `requirements-promo.txt` - Promo videos (pillow, librosa)
  - `requirements-sheet-music.txt` - Sheet music (pypdf, reportlab, pyyaml)
  - `requirements.txt` - Cloud uploads (boto3)
  - `requirements-research.txt` - Document hunting (playwright)
- **Model tier consistency test** in `run_tests.py` - Validates SKILL.md model assignments match model-strategy.md, reports tier distribution, detects `disable-model-invocation` flags
- **Cross-references** added to reference docs (v5-best-practices, distribution, pronunciation-guide, checkpoint-scripts) linking related skills and docs
- **Task-oriented guide table** in `reference/suno/README.md` - "When to Use Which Guide" quick lookup

### Fixed
- **Security: ffmpeg command injection** in `generate_promo_video.py` - Switched from `text=` (injectable via title/artist strings) to `textfile=` parameter with temp files
- **Silent audio crash** in `master_tracks.py` - Added guards for `-inf` LUFS from silent/near-silent audio, skips instead of crashing
- **Case-insensitive WAV discovery** in `master_tracks.py` - Now finds `.WAV` and `.wav` files
- **PIL file handle leak** in `generate_promo_video.py` - `Image.open()` now uses `with` block
- **Shallow copy bug** in `indexer.py` - `existing_state.copy()` replaced with `copy.deepcopy()` to prevent nested dict mutation
- **Race conditions** in `indexer.py` - Added `try/except OSError` around 4 `stat()` calls where files could be deleted between glob and stat
- **Whitespace in Suno Link parsing** in `parsers.py` - Added `.strip()` and en-dash to exclusion list
- **Sources Verified false positive** in `parsers.py` - Reordered matching to check "pending" before "verified", preventing "NOT verified" matching as verified
- **Model tier test substring matching** in `run_tests.py` - Used exact `### heading` regex instead of substring match (prevented "about" matching in prose, "researcher" matching "researchers-legal")

### Changed
- **SKILL_INDEX.md** realigned all 38 skills with model-strategy.md (added missing Opus/Sonnet skills, corrected tier assignments)
- **Album template** (`templates/album.md`) - Replaced hardcoded artist text with generic guidance, renamed distributor heading
- Removed `disable-model-invocation: true` from `release-director` and `skill-model-updater` skills
- Test runner timeout now configurable via `BITWIZE_TEST_TIMEOUT` env var (default: 60s)
- Removed redundant `import re` in `run_tests.py`

  - Runs parser unit tests as subprocess

### Changed
- Session Start in CLAUDE.md now uses state cache instead of scanning markdown files
  - Reduces startup from 50-220 file reads to 2-3 file reads
  - Falls back to full rebuild if cache missing, corrupted, or schema changed
  - Shows last session context (album, phase, pending actions)
- Resume skill now reads from state cache instead of glob + individual file reads
  - Reduces per-invocation from 15-50 file reads to 1-2 file reads

- CLAUDE.md "Finding Albums" section now references state cache as primary lookup before Glob fallback
- CLAUDE.md "Resuming Work" section updated to describe state cache workflow
- CLAUDE.md Session Start step 2 uses full `python3 {plugin_root}/tools/state/indexer.py` paths consistently

### Fixed
- **Critical**: `indexer.py` now runnable as `python3 tools/state/indexer.py` (was failing with `ModuleNotFoundError`)
  - Added `sys.path` fixup at top of file (same pattern as test files)
  - CLAUDE.md and resume SKILL.md both documented the broken form
- `documents_root` default now derives from `content_root` instead of CWD
  - `audio_root` default also derives from `content_root`
  - Prevents wrong paths when running from a different directory
- Tracklist parser now handles variable column counts (3+ columns)
  - Previously required exactly 5 columns; silently returned 0 tracks if template changed
  - Extracts track number (first col), title (second col), status (last col)
  - Emits warning if Tracklist section exists but no rows matched
- `state.session` was dead code — no write mechanism existed
  - Added `session` CLI command to `indexer.py`
  - Resume skill step 5 now calls `indexer.py session` to persist context

### Fixed

## [0.12.1] - 2026-01-26

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed mastering-engineer skill to run scripts from plugin directory instead of copying them to audio folders
  - Scripts now use dynamic plugin path finding (version-independent)
  - Uses `find` command to locate latest plugin version automatically
  - Scripts invoked with audio path as argument instead of cd-ing to audio folder
  - Removed all instructions to copy scripts (cp command)
  - Added "Important: Script Location" section with CRITICAL warning
  - Added Common Mistakes section with 5 error patterns:
    - Don't copy scripts to audio folders
    - Don't hardcode plugin version number
    - Don't run scripts without path argument
    - Don't forget to activate venv
    - Don't use wrong path for mastered verification
  - Updated "Per-Album Session" workflow to use dynamic paths
  - Added regression test to prevent recurrence

**Root cause**: Previous documentation implied scripts lived in audio folder by saying "navigate to folder, run python3 analyze_tracks.py", causing Claude to copy scripts first. Plugin version numbers in cache path (0.12.0, 0.13.0, etc.) meant hardcoded paths would break after updates.

**Impact**: Audio folders now stay clean (only audio files), scripts always use latest version, plugin updates don't break mastering workflow.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-01-26

### Added
- **Complete override support for 10 skills** - All creative/stylistic skills now support user customization via `{overrides}` directory
  - `album-art-director` → `album-art-preferences.md` (visual style, color palettes, composition)

  - `release-director` → `release-preferences.md` (QA checklist, platform priorities, metadata standards, timeline)
  - `sheet-music-publisher` → `sheet-music-preferences.md` (page layout, notation, songbook formatting)
  - Previously added (0.7.x): explicit-checker, lyric-writer, suno-engineer, mastering-engineer, album-conceptualizer, pronunciation-specialist

- `/album-ideas` skill - Track and manage album concepts before creating directories
  - Commands: list, add, remove, status, show, edit
